SublimeLinter-contrib-codespell
-------------------------------

This linter plugin for SublimeLinter provides an interface to codespell.


Ensure that a `codespell` is actually installed somewhere on your system. Typically,


    $ pip install codespell


on the command line will do that.

After installing make sure you can actually run it. E.g.


    $ codespell --version


You don't have to install it globally though, as always put the executable
wherever you want and point SublimeLinter to it.  For example, in the global
settings:


    "linters": {
        "codespell": {
            "executable": "C:\\Users\\honkytonk\\Downloads\\codespell\\codespell.exe"
        },
        ...
